# JS & CSS development
You need grunt installed to compile the coffeescript and less files.
To compile all files run `grunt dev`.

## JS
To compile the coffeescript run:
`grunt js`

## CSS
To compile the less files run:
`grunt css`

## Watch Tasks
Instead of executing the command everytime you change a file, grunt can watch for changes.
Use the following commands instead:
```
grunt watch:dev
grunt watch:js
grunt watch:css
```
